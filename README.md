# C-SE-Engineering-Project
LMS 
Our team will create a Learning Management System, which can store a student's relative information, including their grades, GPA, and what courses they are apart of. The system will also allow the professor to edit student's grades and display relevant information to the professor, and will alow admins to have full access to information. This means that an admin can add, remove, and modify any course information, professors or student's infromation.

The program will allow all reporting purpose, progress in the course, completed semesters years, coming semester year curriculum details, final exam result etc., student’s name, student’s ID, registered courses in the current semester, each exam’s score in one course, GPA calculation in the current semester.

There will be two types of accessing modes, administrator and user. The administrator will be allocated the ability to make changes, updates and see all user's information. The user is either an instructor or a student. Both are allowed to view their data, but make no changes to the data, with the exception of the instructor's ability to edit the student's grades.
